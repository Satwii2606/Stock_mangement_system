# Stock_mangement_system

 Overview:
 
The Stock Management System is a menu-driven, terminal-based application developed using Core Java.
It is designed to manage inventory items, suppliers, and stock levels efficiently through a simple command-line interface.

This project focuses on applying object-oriented programming concepts and Java Collections to build a structured and maintainable system without using external frameworks.

 Problem Statement:

In many small and medium-scale businesses, stock details are often maintained manually using notebooks or spreadsheets.

This approach can lead to:
Data inconsistency
Difficulty in tracking stock levels
Human errors such as overstocking or stock shortages
Lack of a structured way to update and manage inventory
There is a need for a simple and organized system to manage inventory efficiently.

 Solution:
 
To address these challenges, this project provides a console-based Stock Management System that allows users to:
Manage inventory items
Track stock availability
Perform updates in a structured and centralized manner
The system runs entirely in the terminal, where the console acts as the frontend, and Core Java handles the backend logic.

 Features:

Menu-driven command-line interface
Add new inventory items
View available stock details
Update item quantities
Delete inventory items
In-memory data storage using Java Collections
Modular and maintainable code structure

 Technologies Used:

Java (Core Java)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java Collections Framework
Exception Handling
Command-Line Interface (CLI)
